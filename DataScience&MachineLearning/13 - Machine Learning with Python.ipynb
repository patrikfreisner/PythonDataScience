    "### NumPy \n",
    "##### which is a math library to work with N-dimensional arrays in Python. It enables you to do computation efficiently and effectively. It is better than regular Python because of its amazing capabilities. For example, for working with arrays, dictionaries, functions, datatypes and working with images you need to know NumPy\n",
    "### SciPy \n",
    "##### is a collection of numerical algorithms and domain specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization, statistics and much more. SciPy is a good library for scientific and high performance computation. \n",
    "### Matplotlib \n",
    "##### is a very popular plotting package that provides 2D plotting, as well as 3D plotting.\n",
    "### Scikit-Learn\n",
    "##### is a collection of algorithms and tools for machine learning which is our focus here and which you'll learn to use within this course. As we'll be using SciKit Learn quite a bit in the labs, let me explain more about it and show you why it is so popular among data scientists. SciKit Learn is a free Machine Learning Library for the Python programming language. It has most of the classification, regression and clustering algorithms, and it's designed to work with a Python numerical and scientific libraries: NumPy and SciPy."
